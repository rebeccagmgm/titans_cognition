// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// SqlDocument — the persistent, immutable per-document model.
//
// Today every LSP feature re-parses the raw text per request and analyze()
// re-parses internally. SqlDocument is a per-open-file model that runs the
// schema-free pipeline ONCE in create() and caches every tier, is immutable
// (an edit yields a NEW instance via withText), and is position-addressable
// (tokenAt / nodeAt). The schema-dependent passes run lazily in analyze(schema)
// and are memoized by schema identity.
//
// STATEMENT CELLS (Task 5): the document is split into per-statement cells
// (src/document/split.ts) and each cell is parsed independently, so an edit
// inside one statement only re-parses that statement's cell — the unchanged
// cells are reused across withText() via a content-addressed cache (keyed by
// dialect + cell text, carried from parent to child). `statements` / `cellAt`
// are the real per-statement surface; the whole-document facade fields
// (`ast`/`cst`/`scopes`/`tokens`/`diagnostics`/`errors`) stay identical to a
// single whole-doc parse for a single-cell document (byte-exact back-compat)
// and keep today's compound-flagged shape for a multi-cell one.
//
// It is the public-API extension — the stateful-but-immutable front of the
// otherwise-stateless `api` functions — so it COMPOSES the public surface
// (parse / toScopes / qualify / deriveSymbols / TypeInfo) rather than reaching
// into the internal analysis modules. Core: antlr4ng only, no LSP deps here.
//
// On the api ↔ document import direction: api.ts re-exports SqlDocument and
// document.ts imports the api functions. That cycle is fine in ESM because
// document.ts only CALLS the api functions at call time (inside create() and
// analyze()), never at module-evaluation time — there are no top-level api
// calls in this file, so the modules finish evaluating before either is used.

 *  identical Spark 4.0 `|>` syntax, https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-pipe-syntax.html.
 *  Walks the stage chain from the LAST stage backward:
 *   - a terminal `select` stage fully redefines the column set. Its stage scope's own body is a
 *     synthesized "select" (`stageBody` in scope.ts), so it re-enters the `select` branch above
 *     verbatim (star expansion included: `qualify()` populates `expandStarOf` for a pipe SELECT's
 *     star exactly as it does for a real one);
 *   - a terminal `aggregate` stage names the GROUP BY keys first, then the aggregate expressions:
 *     "The output columns from the AGGREGATE operator include all grouping columns first, followed
 *     by all aggregate columns" (the reference's own wording; Spark's pipe-syntax page says the same:
 *     "the evaluated grouping expressions followed by the evaluated aggregate functions"). See
 *     `pipeAggregateColumns`;
 *   - a terminal PASS-THROUGH stage (where/orderBy/limit/distinct/tablesample/assert/log/
 *     staticDescribe/with/set/setop/recursiveUnion, none of which change the column set, matching
 *     `stageOutputsFree`'s identical passthrough set, scope.ts's schema-free name-only twin of this
 *     function) defers to whatever precedes it;
 *   - falling through every stage reaches the pipe's own base `input`, whose output columns (a real
 *     SELECT's projections, or another pipe/setop) pass through unchanged.
 *  Every other terminal stage kind ABSTAINS (`[]`, never a guessed column list), because either the
 *  shape change has no simple per-column span to anchor on (`extend`/`window` ADD columns via their
 *  own projections but also keep the incoming ones, which carry no token at this stage; `drop`/
 *  `rename` transform the incoming NAME list, but a renamed column's real token is the OLD name, so
 *  showing it at the new name would misrepresent the span) or the new columns need a catalog this
 *  pass doesn't have (`join`/`call`/`pivot`/`unpivot`/`matchRecognize`) or the operator is
 *  terminal/branching/unmodelled (`describe`/`staticDescribe` narrows to a fixed schema, `if`/`fork`/
